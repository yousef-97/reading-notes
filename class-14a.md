### transforms :
properties for transforms:
- 2D transform (transform:rotate(degree))
- 2D scale : (its can be more thne 1 )(transform: scaleX(1.25);or Y or (X,Y))
- 2D Skew : you can use it horizantally or verticlally
### Combining Transforms:
It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once

### Transitions & Animations
transition: to take place, an element must have a change in state like hover.  
some properties:
- transtion property:choose which property will change 
- transition-duration:
- transition-timing-function: used to set the speed in which a transition will move
- transition-delay:determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing
