## JS Events:
the ways to bind an event to an element:
 - HTML veent handler
 - traditional DOM event handlers
 - DOM 2 event listenre 
  ### using the Parameters with event handlers & listeners
  we connont have paraentheses after the function name in event handler or ,passing arguments requires aworkround.  
  if you want to pass an argument you have to ues **anonymous function.**
  i think its like make a function to call another function.
  ### using parameter with event listeners:
  use apaameter before using anonymous function.
