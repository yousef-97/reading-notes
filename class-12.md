# canvas
it's like img element but it doesn't have the src and alt attributes.it's  used to draw graphics via JS and html(, it can be used for animation,
game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing)

### drawing rectangles
some of the functions:
- fillRect(x,y,width,height):Draws a filled rectangle.
- strokeRect(x, y, width, height) :Draws a rectangular outline.
- clearRect(x, y, width, height)
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
**x and y specify the position on the canvas ( (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle),width and height provide the rectangle's size.**
and you can draw paths to draw shaps.
 


## styling
### color
 there are two important properties we can use for styling:
 - fillStyle =color
 - strokeStyle = color
 ### transparency
 globalAlpha = transparencyValue (0-1)
 or use rgba(r,g,b,transparencyValue)
