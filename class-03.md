## HTML LISTS
three type of lists :
- order list
- bullet list (unordered)
- definition list(for definition stuff)
and you can apply a nested list

## css Boxes
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents.
- width, height :used to set the dimensions
you can use a limiting width and height: to ensure that the content of pages are legible.
- overflow: if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself you should use overflow.
- using border padding and margin to make the site more ordered
- centering elements by using text-algin
- you can border imanges and boxes shadows


## JS 
### switch 
its beter than if statement in reading code 
 and easier.  <br />
 the diffrence between if and switch:
- There is no need to provide an else option
- With a series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found
- You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match. 
- If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running.
### loops
means to repeating the code again
there is three type :
1. while loop(if you know how many time should run)
1. for loop (its like acounter to tell you how many times the code should run)
1. do while loop(like while loop but this state have to do the code one time at least)
