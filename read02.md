# JQUERY
JQuery is javaScript file that you include in your web pages.it lets you find elementa using CSS-style selctors and then do some thing with elements using JQuery methods.</br>
1- you can find elements using css style selectors</br>
2- you can play with elements using methods
## WHY USE JQuery
***it make coding simpler:***
- simple selectors
- common tasks  in less code (loop through elements
,Add I remove elements from the DOM tree
,Handle events
,Fade elements into I out of view)
- cross-borwser compatibilty
### a matched set/JQuery seleciton
- single element(if the selector returns one element)
- multiple elements(if the selector returns sevral element)you can use index to chose an element
### get and set data:
.html()method if its empty thats mean you want to get data**but**if its filled thats mean you want to set data.
### looping 
When you want to get information from a series of elements, you can use the [. each () ]method
### CHAINING
If you want to use more than one jQuery method on the same selection of elements, you can list several methods at a time using dot notation to separate each one.
### READY Method
.ready method checks that the page is ready for your code to work with.
### getting element content
by using .html()or .text()
the diffrance is html will get the content what ever its type (text ,html elements)
but text will get the text only.
### upddating elements:
- .html()
- .text()
- .replaceWith()
- .remove()
### inserting elements
- .before()
- .after()
- .prepend()
- .append()
