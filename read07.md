### How does the web work:
**HTTP**HyperText Transfer Protocol: one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing<br />
it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.(it's like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.)
The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST(**REpresentational-State-Transfer**) provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
#### redirect:
 sending the user from a URL to another URL. In Javascript, window.location function is used to redirect to a URL.
 #### polymorphism:
 it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes(For example, given a base class shape, polymorphism enables the programmer to define different area methods, such as circles, rectangles and triangles. No matter what shape an object is, applying the area method to it will return the correct results.)
